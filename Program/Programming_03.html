<p style="font-size:30px; font-family: Arial;">Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs. It involves using specialized languages, tools, and techniques to instruct a computer to perform specific tasks. Programmers use programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. Programming is a fundamental skill in today's digital age, as it underpins much of the technology we rely on every day, from smartphones and computers to cars and airplanes. Whether you are interested in developing software applications, creating websites, or exploring data science and artificial intelligence, learning to code is an essential step towards a rewarding and lucrative career in technology.
